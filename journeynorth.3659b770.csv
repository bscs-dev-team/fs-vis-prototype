Thought I would miss them here, but have had lovely hummers here every day since we arrived and set up the feeders. They  are bigger birds and sit for quite a while at the feeders and drink.Mostly green/tan backs and iridescent purpley red heads. Today I saw a totally bright green one at the feeder. Thinking they are mostly Anna's Hummingbirds but the one today was quite unusual and brilliant. Very happy they are all here and it seems like they will be here year-round ","1,526,499,009"

I reported that I thought  the butterfly didnâ€™t have a proboscis. I took the butterfly inside to live in an enclosure and finally she showed her proboscis after a couple days. I named her Miss Crinkles. She continued to live doing very well and was very smart. She knew where her food (green Gatorade and orange slices) was and would be active at times crawling all around the sides of the enclosure. She even knew when it was nighttime and would go sleep on the top of the enclosure. Miss Crinkles sadly died today despite doing so well and being active the day before.So she lived for about 40 days, a little over a month. I wanted to report this observation to give my thoughts that she maybe was of the premigrating generation in that if she was healthy, she might have laid eggs further south for the migrating generation as some monarchs do from way up here in Maine. Also, the length of time that she lived suggests this. I wanted to contribute this information to Journey North if it can be used for scientific data. This was an experiment to see how long this butterfly would live if that it could be on the migrating generation and maybe live until March or April.","1,526,498,970"

I placed it in a large plastic container, and brought it inside where the temps were in the low 60s. After about an hour, I saw it was trying to stand upright, so I placed a few drops of hummingbird nectar nearby. A couple hours later, the nectar was gone and the Monarch appeared more active. Shortly after, it was attempting to fly. Outside the temps were now in the low 60s, so I carried the container outside and released it. It flew out and away, heading south. Yay!

As the weather was starting to get cold, I put the milkweed pot in my greenhouse on November 24th, so that the larvae could get larger. I had a butterfly popup from some Painted Ladies that we helped many years ago and used it to put the larvae in when I saw it get off the milkweed on Dec. 3rd. On Dec. 4th, it had climbed to the top of the popup tent and started to form a Ã¯Â¿Â½J.Ã¯Â¿Â½ On the morning of Dec. 5th, it had formed a chrysalis. It is still in chrysalis in my greenhouse now. I expect it to come out of chrysalis any day now. I am really not sure if I should feed it nectar (sugar water or orange slices) for a while until we get a warm day or really what to do with it. I can keep it in the popup in the greenhouse as long as necessary. Any advice would be helpful. This is my second time to do this. The first one, a male, flew away on a nice day on November 27th. Please contact me with advice. Thank you. Ellen L.","1,526,498,837"

We even had a group of three or four circling together in the air, at different times.  These butterflies were definitely in migration mode.  I'm hoping most crossed the Bay today, as winds were negligble  and very few were stopping to find nectar, which is scarce after our frost, unfortunately.  I then decided to do a point count which came to 18 monarchs in fifteen minutes.

The same thing happened later in the day.  This is so stunning to me, because I'm still trying to wrap my brain around having a hummingbird in November - and now there is a second one.  I have not gotten a good look at the second bird, and my first impression was that it was a ruby-throated, but I haven't seen it long enough to be sure.

Its wings were vey wrinkled, folded and ripped. I donÃ¯Â¿Â½t think it was a late migrator because it seemed to be missing itÃ¯Â¿Â½s proboscis and therefore not able to feed. There is absolutely nothing to nectar on anyway as all asters, goldenrod, and other wildflowers have gone to seed.I think it is one of the last couple of caterpillars that were on milkweed in the garden that disappeared mid September right before I could get them to to bring them inside to help them along. There is a rock pile nearby and the caterpillar could have chose that spot for its chrysalis. Maybe it didnÃ¯Â¿Â½t leave enough space for itself to its wings to form properly and thus its crumpled wings which could have torn crawling out of the rock pile as it made its way to sit on the plant. Mid to late October had some cold temperatures here in the 30s and nights in the teens. This underscores the slow pace of butterfly development as temperatures get colder. ItÃ¯Â¿Â½s amazing that it eclosed in the first place. I have had about a week of warm temperatures in the mid 60s and fairly warm nights in the mid 40s now so maybe that pushed it across the finish line to eclose. This is all just my hypothesis but it is my best guess.Temperature about 65, sunny, very light wind.","1,526,497,585"

All arrived from the north on the west side of the Tip. Most continued along west shoreline out to Tip &amp; out over the lake...no hesitation. A few crossed the sandy penninsula to east shoreline &amp; continued same. Most arrived low to shoreline 2-5' up then gaining altitude while others as they arrived were already 20'-30' up. An incredible amazing Nov day which continues another three days. Highs of 10Ã¯Â¿Â½c &amp; sunny afterward which is not so bad. Light to moderate SW wind but favourable north wind at end of this week.

While my roof is temporarily covered from hurricane damage, IÃ¯Â¿Â½m less concerned about the roof and more curious to see what the hummingbirds do as Zeta is due to approach at pre-Dawn this Thursday.  Will they retreat soon by flying southwest, skirting the Texas coastline toward Mexico?  Or, will some make the trek across the Gulf of Mexico, even though the hurricane is due to start traversing those waters today? This morning they interact amusingly, by flying vertically, like twin beings on parallel pulleys, much like the mating rituals. Sometimes they chase each other off the feeders and off the cigar blossoms. They also tolerate each other, one feeding at the feeder while the other sits perched atop the shepherdsÃ¯Â¿Â½ hook.

My home and property actually sit in Cullowhee,NC,but the mailing address is Sylva,NC due to the US Mail delivery route not delivering on unpaved roads. I planted milkweed, bee balm, butterfly bushes, wildflowers and other flowering shrubs after getting the CO to move into my home on Sept. 17, 2003. I have seen hummingbirds and many other types of pollenators every year. But this is the first time I ever saw a monarch butterfly and I have been watching for them every year. All I saw was the one, but I am hoping there are more around. Really hoping this means that they will begin showing up here on a regular basis next spring!Happy that I just discovered this site to view other sightings as well as to report my own of the monarch, hummingbirds,and any other wildlife for research purposes.","1,526,496,099"

I raised and released 105 monarchs about 2 weeks ago. Unfortunately tropical milkweed were the only plants I could find. Next year I will try to plant native milkweed.   I thought the season was over but now 2 female monarchs are hovering over the milkweed and they seem to be guarding it and searching my yard for more. They have been doing this for over a week. I'm pretty sure they are the same 2 butterflies and they will not leave. I also have tithonia, and asters in full bloom. Now I see tiny caterpillars and eggs on the milkweed plants.  This is Oct 18, 2020. Maybe these caterpillars will be overwintering in the eucalyptus grove near the Pismo Beach area. I will bring them inside soon. I'm an amateur but this is my 5th summer saving monarchs. ","1,526,491,975"

We have a dry cool front expected tonight (Thursday, 10/15) and that may herald their return to Mexico within the following two days after the front. I will be watching and counting. There are a few things we did differently this past season. Our annual termite foundation-treatment was postponed to November, since the foundation plantings are within 20 feet of the nectar plants. We are also switching from insecticidal treatment to non-deadly bait stations. We planted more nectar plants away from the house, and we were able to stop all parish (county for non-Louisianians) mosquito spraying on the country roads adjoining our property. That seemed to increase the insect population needed for hummingbird protein. We still experience some spray over from the rice farms which surround our acreage, but that hasnÃ¯Â¿Â½t deterred the hummingbirds from visiting. By the way, I change out the nectar once or twice a day, and IÃ¯Â¿Â½ve noticed that they gravitate toward the colder refrigerated nectar.

Our intention of bringing her chrysalis to Virginia was to provide food for nectaring once she hatched.  A second chrysalis did not fully develop. It also traveled with us.

Although a few butterflies were flying around (10-15), most were sitting on the flowers, so it was hard to see them unless I disturbed the grass and they would fly up.   I could not walk too far into the grass because it is wet marsh. The area where the flowers are growing is closer to the road and is about 100 yards by 50 yards.  I made an estimate of 50 because I rustled the marsh grass about 10 times as I was taking photos, and each time 3-4 would fly up and go to another flower. I could also see a few fluttering around.

I have a certain amount of butterfly bushes, planted specifically for the monarchs. Usually, they arrive, one at the time, and rest on the bushes for a while and then continue their migration after 10-15mn. So, I assume that if I see them leaving, they don&rsquo;t try to fool me by turning around and coming back. If I see, like on Saturday, a constant stream of 4-5 butterflies on the bushes, for a period from 8AM to 4PM or 8H, my count of 20 is probably on a low side. I am out in the yard starting around 8AM and try to check the bushes regularly.    In Fort Lee, I believe we are right on the path of the New England migration; they cross the Hudson over Manhattan, Fort Lee, and Secaucus. I always see them coming from the North-East going South-West. They dive on the butterfly bushes (the only bushes flowering right now), go from bush to bush for nectar, and after 10-15 mn fly over the oak trees and disappear to the South-South-West. I never saw them at a roost in my neighborhood.","1,526,490,440"

This was taken at 5:58 just before sundown. clear skies, high 60s, light wind. my guess is about 100 in this roost. A few others about 50. others that I could not see.The roosts were in an area that I had walked through earlier. I walked for about 2 hours between 3:30 and 5:30 and observed the roosts from about 5:30 to sundown about 6:20. The roosts are also only visible from the boardwalk. I am not permitted to walk out into the dunes to look for other sites or to get a different angle. so those views are limited. It's been my experience that the roosts are usually on the east side of trees. I have not noted the wind direction with roosts. I have assumed that they are trying to position themselves to get the morning sun. Some of the areas of goldenrod were big patched while others were more interspersed with dune grasses and other plants. Yesterday the butterflies were widely dispersed. There were a few plants that had several butterflies, but I'd say none had more than 4.For the roosts I just guessed at the number. I did not try to count them.The roosts were in an area that I had walked through earlier. I walked for about 2 hours between 3:30 and 5:30 and observed the roosts from about 5:30 to sundown about 6:20. The roosts are also only visible from the boardwalk.

,Site 50759,2020-10-09,40.629,-73.228,Monarch PEAK Migration,500,"Yesterday afternoon I saw at least 500. Most where feeding on Goldenrod. it was hard to count but I think 500 is minimum. I didn't count the ones I saw in roosts because they were probable the same ones I saw feedingI was using a counter for most of the time I was walking and counted 466. But stopped counting near the end. So I estimated 500. There is a boardwalk that runs through an area of dunes and a road that comes back through a similar but different area. Total length about 1,5 miles. The goldenrod is spread out on both sides of the path. In some places you can see a few hundred feet from the path. In others only a few feet. I counted as many as I could see, realizing that some may have been double counted but that there were also others that would be on plants and not visible. If I double back through an area I don't count in that area again. I walked for about 2 hours between 3:30 and 5:30 and observed the roosts (see other report under Fall Roost) from about 5:30 to sundown about 6:20.  I am not permitted to walk out into the dunes to look for other sites or to get a different angle. so those views are limited.  Some of the areas of goldenrod were big patched while others were more interspersed with dune grasses and other plants. Yesterday (10/10) the butterflies were widely dispersed.

Clusters of butterflies perched on branches and many flying around the trees. Would estimate well over 100We were traveling through Eden on our way to San Angelo and only happened to stop at the city park for a lunch break.  It was about 12:30 pm and we stayed about a half hour. Unfortunately I can&rsquo;t speak to when the roost formed, because we were only their briefly. Roosting is a good description of what I saw though. I had to look twice before I realized they were butterflies, not leaves. Some were flying small distances around the trees, and many were perched on branches. I didn&rsquo;t want to overestimate or exaggerate the number of butterflies so I said 100 as a very conservative estimate. I could easily see there were a couple of dozen in each of the tall oak trees near me. Across the playground there were more trees and I could see butterflies flying in little flocks and settling back into the trees. Honestly, after looking more closely at my pictures and factoring in all the other trees in the park I could see the number being more like 400-500. I&rsquo;m not sure about nectar sources. I didn&rsquo;t notice flowers in the park but there were open fields to the east of the park playground area. The park is on the edge of town in a plains area with grasses, I think some scrub oaks and sage, and some farming and/or ranching. It was a shady area on a hot day, with a little breeze. The trees, playground equipment, and buildings around the park would have offered some shelter from the wind. The park was much more shady and cool than the surrounding area. https://youtu.be/CRBbrvZUhdESee video of<a href=""https://youtu.be/USgFIiMHH38"">Eden City Park Monarch Roost, Oct 8, 2020</a>  on Journey North YouTube Channel.

,Site 38292,2020-10-08,38.937,-74.969,Monarch PEAK Migration,"10,000","Report from Cape May Monarch Monitoring Project. Tremendous numbers of monarchs have been at Cape May Point for the last 4 days, feeding on seaside goldenrod along the dunes and in various gardens around town.  Roosts of up to 1200 have been found in the late afternoons.  It's impossible to come up with anything resembling an accurate count; 10,000 is certainly low.Additional notes posted 10/12/20: We had seven consecutive days with a lot of monarchs here, which is quite unusual &mdash; usually when we see a big spike in numbers it decreases within 2 or 3 days.  We watched a lot departing on day 5, but more arrived that day and the numbers stayed very high.  Today (10/12/20) is day 8 and it&rsquo;s very rainy and windy - it will be interesting to see how many monarchs will be around when the weather clears.We found between 5 and 10 roosting clusters each night, and often would hear about a roosting group that we hadn&rsquo;t found the next day.  One of our team members methodically counted one of the clusters and came up with 1200.  I feel quite certain that 10,000 is a conservative estimate.During the day we were seeing monarchs nectaring on seaside goldenrod, which grows abundantly on the dunes and upper beach, all the way from Cape May Point to the east end of Cape May City, more than 2 miles distant.  They were also actively nectaring in gardens on flowers such as New England Aster, Mexican Sunflower, Zinnias, Coneflowers, etc., on the flowers of Butterfly Bush and Crape Myrtle, and on the flowers of English Ivy vines, the latter flowers seemingly more than ever.  You couldn&rsquo;t go anywhere within 100 meters of the coast without seeing a lot of monarchs in the air.Temperatures have remained relatively warm throughout this period, so not all monarchs formed roosting clusters overnight, some just settled into the vegetation along the dunes and in other habitats near the shore, while others did cluster &mdash; and those roosting clusters occurred in a variety of plants, including pines, junipers, aspens, and even right in the ivy vines.  We found roosts from the extreme SW corner of Cape May Point east to Cape May Point State Park, and we heard of roosts about 2 miles north near the shores of Delaware Bay, an area known as Town Bank.  There were no doubt some roosting clusters in Cape May City as well, but we didn&rsquo;t search there.Most of the days through this stretch were a bit warmer than the seasonal average with sunny or mostly sunny conditions, winds ranged from light to moderate, from the northwest many days but switching to the southwest several times.  <a href=""https://njaudubon.org/monarch-monitoring/"">Cape May Monarch Monitoring Project Website</a>","1,526,490,050"

Deciduous trees wrapped in English Ivy. I am sure I underestimated the number-significantly.

Winds out of the NW, some started to leave but many came down to eat breakfast on the Ivy. I have many photos &amp; some video...Roost first formed, Oct 7.

They are being well-fed if they eat mosquitoes, which were also pushed inland in droves from the coastal marshes. This is the latest we have ever had any hummers. Theyâ€™d  always journeyed south before October came. The hummingbirds are feeding from the plants: firespike, shrimp plant, bleeding heart, firebush, passionflower vine, Major Wheeler honeysuckle vine, Porter weed, cigar plant, Chinese lantern, and have even chased away Monarch butterflies to get nectar from the milkweed plants.  They also feed from the ten nectar feeders that we refill every day. So far, 2020 has given us nearly eight months to host hummingbirds here in the deep south.

He was perching in the bottle brush and chasing the Ruby Throated females away from the bottle brush he deemed as his. I initially heard a different sound that I recognized as a hummingbird but the warning chirps were different than the female and male Ruby Throated species. The sounds he was making were what initially caught my attention. I then observed from approximately 20Ã¯Â¿Â½ away and eventually saw him drinking nectar and perching on a branch. The lighting was not dim but also not extremely bright and I was able to see he was a beautiful rust color with darker wings and a white spot on his breast. I did try to get an image with my phone but it is very grainy but I can make him out. IÃ¯Â¿Â½ll post it but it may be of no help.

It&rsquo;s a research station of The American Museum of Natural History.I&rsquo;ve been seeing roosting monarchs on Great Gull Island for years, first time in 1975 or 1976 (about 75 on a Privet Bush- before the Black Pines were big. They were planted in 1975.). I've seen them roosting on and off, but really have just started paying attention. The Pines are the largest trees on island, and only about 4 are left alive. No other trees to speak of except a pear tree, and Bayberry bushes covered in bittersweet vines.This year I pretty much counted most of the individuals [in the roost] and then estimated what I couldn&rsquo;t see clearly on backside of branches. This year they favored the small Japanese Black Pines, but I&rsquo;ve seen them in past in the large Privet that grows next to one of the old forts (Fort Michie) towers. This year I was only on the island for about 10 days at end of September (24)into October (5). Monarchs were noticeably less plentiful this year as well as fewer other butterflies too. They typically find and roost in spots in the grove that are protected from the wind (we had some 50mph winds while I was there). Good bird migration days(NW winds) seemed to be good monarch days also. Gull Island is right on the migratory bird flyway....","1,526,489,640"
