Surface and emergent vegetation covers most of the pond's surface.  The emergent vegetation grows from the shoreline to several feet into the pond.  The vegetation is so thick, I have seen frogs resting on top of it.  Cattails and water hemlock grow on some the the vegetation mats.  Willows grow along much of the shore.  With the exception of one large oak, the dike has no trees.  The Park personnel regularly maintain the dike. The pond is surrounded by forest.  I have seen water bubbling from the ground on the southwest corner of the pond, so I suspect that it is spring fed.  The pond supports a population of mosquito fish (Gambusia).  The floodplain for Henley Creek is located within about 1/4 mile south of the pond.  This floodplain normally has several vernal pools.","From the instersection of Highway 34 and Highway 248 in the town of Ninety Six, travel two miles south on Highway 248.

The barrier is a simple concrete wall placed as a barrier to the stream's natural progression. The pond created by the barrier is approx 30 wide and 40 feet deep. The pond is filled with the plant growth you'd expect for the region. There are abundent reeds and water plants both in, along the edge of and nearby to the pond.

The barrier is a simple concrete wall placed as a barrier to the stream's natural progression. The pond created by the barrier is approx 30 wide and 40 feet deep. The pond is filled with the plant growth you'd expect for the region. There are abundent reeds and water plants both in, along the edge of and nearby to the pond.

With the exception of one large oak, the dike has no trees.  The Park personnel regularly maintain the dike. The pond is surrounded by forest.  I have seen water bubbling from the ground on the southwest corner of the pond, so I suspect that it is spring fed.  The pond supports a population of mosquito fish (Gambusia).  The floodplain for Henley Creek is located within about 1/4 mile south of the pond.  This floodplain normally has several vernal pools.","From the instersection of Highway 34 and Highway 248 in the town of Ninety Six, travel two miles south on Highway 248.  The visitor's center for Ninety Six National Historic Site is located on the left.  To get to the pond, walk on the paved trail past the visitor's center to the battlefield.  Follow the trail to the Star Fort.  At the fort, leave the trail and look for an unpaved trail behind the star.  This unpaved trail takes you to a service road, also unpaved.  Turn right onto this service road and take an almost immediate left on a perpendicular service road.

With the exception of one large oak, the dike has no trees.  The Park personnel regularly maintain the dike. The pond is surrounded by forest.  I have seen water bubbling from the ground on the southwest corner of the pond, so I suspect that it is spring fed.  The pond supports a population of mosquito fish (Gambusia).

With the exception of one large oak, the dike has no trees.  The Park personnel regularly maintain the dike. The pond is surrounded by forest.  I have seen water bubbling from the ground on the southwest corner of the pond, so I suspect that it is spring fed.  The pond supports a population of mosquito fish (Gambusia).

The vegetation is so thick, I have seen frogs resting on top of it.  Cattails and water hemlock grow on some the the vegetation mats.  Willows grow along much of the shore.  With the exception of one large oak, the dike has no trees.  The Park personnel regularly maintain the dike. The pond is surrounded by forest.  I have seen water bubbling from the ground on the southwest corner of the pond, so I suspect that it is spring fed.  The pond supports a population of mosquito fish (Gambusia).

Surface and emergent vegetation covers most of the pond's surface.  The emergent vegetation grows from the shoreline to several feet into the pond.  The vegetation is so thick, I have seen frogs resting on top of it.  Cattails and water hemlock grow on some the the vegetation mats.  Willows grow along much of the shore.  With the exception of one large oak, the dike has no trees.  The Park personnel regularly maintain the dike. The pond is surrounded by forest.  I have seen water bubbling from the ground on the southwest corner of the pond, so I suspect that it is spring fed.  The pond supports a population of mosquito fish (Gambusia).  The floodplain for Henley Creek is located within about 1/4 mile south of the pond.  This floodplain normally has several vernal pools.","From the instersection of Highway 34 and Highway 248 in the town of Ninety Six, travel two miles south on Highway 248.

Surface and emergent vegetation covers most of the pond's surface.  The emergent vegetation grows from the shoreline to several feet into the pond.  The vegetation is so thick, I have seen frogs resting on top of it.  Cattails and water hemlock grow on some the the vegetation mats.  Willows grow along much of the shore.  With the exception of one large oak, the dike has no trees.  The Park personnel regularly maintain the dike. The pond is surrounded by forest.  I have seen water bubbling from the ground on the southwest corner of the pond, so I suspect that it is spring fed.  The pond supports a population of mosquito fish (Gambusia).  The floodplain for Henley Creek is located within about 1/4 mile south of the pond.  This floodplain normally has several vernal pools.","From the instersection of Highway 34 and Highway 248 in the town of Ninety Six, travel two miles south on Highway 248.

Surface and emergent vegetation covers most of the pond's surface.  The emergent vegetation grows from the shoreline to several feet into the pond.  The vegetation is so thick, I have seen frogs resting on top of it.  Cattails and water hemlock grow on some the the vegetation mats.  Willows grow along much of the shore.  With the exception of one large oak, the dike has no trees.  The Park personnel regularly maintain the dike. The pond is surrounded by forest.  I have seen water bubbling from the ground on the southwest corner of the pond, so I suspect that it is spring fed.  The pond supports a population of mosquito fish (Gambusia).  The floodplain for Henley Creek is located within about 1/4 mile south of the pond.  This floodplain normally has several vernal pools.","From the instersection of Highway 34 and Highway 248 in the town of Ninety Six, travel two miles south on Highway 248.

Follow the trail to the Star Fort.  At the fort, leave the trail and look for an unpaved trail behind the star.  This unpaved trail takes you to a service road, also unpaved.

With the exception of one large oak, the dike has no trees.  The Park personnel regularly maintain the dike. The pond is surrounded by forest.  I have seen water bubbling from the ground on the southwest corner of the pond, so I suspect that it is spring fed.  The pond supports a population of mosquito fish (Gambusia).
