I heard a few upland chorus frog calling from a nearby wetland.",Ninety Six,Greenwood,South Carolina,Site managed by the National Park Service,Pond,Human-made,Permanent,Pond,"his pond is a fraction of an acre in size.  Surface and emergent vegetation covers most of the pond's surface.  The emergent vegetation grows from the shoreline to several feet into the pond.  The vegetation is so thick, I have seen frogs resting on top of it.  Cattails and water hemlock grow on some the the vegetation mats.  Willows grow along much of the shore.  With the exception of one large oak, the dike has no trees.  The Park personnel regularly maintain the dike. The pond is surrounded by forest.  I have seen water bubbling from the ground on the southwest corner of the pond, so I suspect that it is spring fed.  The pond supports a population of mosquito fish (Gambusia).  The floodplain for Henley Creek is located within about 1/4 mile south of the pond.  This floodplain normally has several vernal pools.","From the instersection of Highway 34 and Highway 248 in the town of Ninety Six, travel two miles south on Highway 248.  The visitor's center for Ninety Six National Historic Site is located on the left.  To get to the pond, walk on the paved trail past the visitor's center to the battlefield.  Follow the trail to the Star Fort.  At the fort, leave the trail and look for an unpaved trail behind the star.  This unpaved trail takes you to a service road, also unpaved.  Turn right onto this service road and take an almost immediate left on a perpendicular service road.  Follow this service road to the small pond."

The vegetation is so thick, I have seen frogs resting on top of it.  Cattails and water hemlock grow on some the the vegetation mats.  Willows grow along much of the shore.  With the exception of one large oak, the dike has no trees.  The Park personnel regularly maintain the dike. The pond is surrounded by forest.  I have seen water bubbling from the ground on the southwest corner of the pond, so I suspect that it is spring fed.  The pond supports a population of mosquito fish (Gambusia).  The floodplain for Henley Creek is located within about 1/4 mile south of the pond.  This floodplain normally has several vernal pools.","From the instersection of Highway 34 and Highway 248 in the town of Ninety Six, travel two miles south on Highway 248.

I have seen water bubbling from the ground on the southwest corner of the pond, so I suspect that it is spring fed.  The pond supports a population of mosquito fish (Gambusia).  The floodplain for Henley Creek is located within about 1/4 mile south of the pond.  This floodplain normally has several vernal pools.","From the instersection of Highway 34 and Highway 248 in the town of Ninety Six, travel two miles south on Highway 248.

With the exception of one large oak, the dike has no trees.  The Park personnel regularly maintain the dike. The pond is surrounded by forest.  I have seen water bubbling from the ground on the southwest corner of the pond, so I suspect that it is spring fed.  The pond supports a population of mosquito fish (Gambusia).  The floodplain for Henley Creek is located within about 1/4 mile south of the pond.  This floodplain normally has several vernal pools.","From the instersection of Highway 34 and Highway 248 in the town of Ninety Six, travel two miles south on Highway 248.

Surface and emergent vegetation covers most of the pond's surface.  The emergent vegetation grows from the shoreline to several feet into the pond.  The vegetation is so thick, I have seen frogs resting on top of it.  Cattails and water hemlock grow on some the the vegetation mats.  Willows grow along much of the shore.  With the exception of one large oak, the dike has no trees.  The Park personnel regularly maintain the dike. The pond is surrounded by forest.  I have seen water bubbling from the ground on the southwest corner of the pond, so I suspect that it is spring fed.  The pond supports a population of mosquito fish (Gambusia).  The floodplain for Henley Creek is located within about 1/4 mile south of the pond.  This floodplain normally has several vernal pools.","From the instersection of Highway 34 and Highway 248 in the town of Ninety Six, travel two miles south on Highway 248.  The visitor's center for Ninety Six National Historic Site is located on the left.  To get to the pond, walk on the paved trail past the visitor's center to the battlefield.  Follow the trail to the Star Fort.  At the fort, leave the trail and look for an unpaved trail behind the star.  This unpaved trail takes you to a service road, also unpaved.  Turn right onto this service road and take an almost immediate left on a perpendicular service road.  Follow this service road to the small pond."
