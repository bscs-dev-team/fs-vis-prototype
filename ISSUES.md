# ISSUES


## REWORK
* Pop up Editr
* When editing existing graph, duplicate?  Or replace?  Only if previously saved?

* Hide Graph area to start?
    --  How do you start a graph?
* Show/Hide Graph Editor
* Does the graph footer bar still make sense?



## MAJOR
* No graph view?  Default "No Filters" has a no graph view?  But then how do you select it again?
* Should FieldSet names just be parameter values?
* Should Saved Graphs view show filter names?


## IMPROVEMENTS
* Help text
    --  Interactive data table
    --  Variable descriptions, protocol
* Orientation Map vs Data Map
    x  "Map of where observations"
* Graphs
    x  Copy to Clipbard
    x  Download PNG
* Language
    --  "playful fun epxlore engage"
    --  PRESETS: "ideas" "stories"
    --  Come explore data

## MINOR
* Does not page table
